Behavior Rules
==============

`BehaviorRuleConfig` is the serializable model for behavior rules. `SecurityConfig.global_behavior_rules: list[BehaviorRuleConfig]` applies those rules to every route, in addition to any decorator-specified rules. Useful for service-wide 404 tracking, frequency caps, and detection-correlated bans.

BehaviorRuleConfig
------------------

```python
class BehaviorRuleConfig(BaseModel):
    rule_type: Literal["usage", "return_pattern", "frequency"]
    threshold: int = Field(ge=1)
    window: int = Field(default=3600, ge=1)
    pattern: str | None = None
    action: Literal["ban", "log", "throttle", "alert"] = "log"
    ban_duration: int | None = Field(default=None, ge=1)
    correlate_with_detection: bool = False
```

| Field                       | Type                                          | Default  | Description                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rule_type`                 | `"usage" \| "return_pattern" \| "frequency"`  | required | Rule kind. `usage` and `frequency` track inbound calls; `return_pattern` matches outbound responses. |
| `threshold`                 | `int`                                         | required | Trigger count within `window` (>= 1).                                                        |
| `window`                    | `int`                                         | `3600`   | Window in seconds.                                                                           |
| `pattern`                   | `str \| None`                                 | `None`   | Match expression for `return_pattern` rules. Status patterns use `"status:404"`; body patterns are matched as substrings. |
| `action`                    | `"ban" \| "log" \| "throttle" \| "alert"`     | `"log"`  | Action when threshold is exceeded.                                                           |
| `ban_duration`              | `int \| None`                                 | `None`   | Override for `auto_ban_duration` when `action="ban"`. When `None`, the ban falls back to 3600 seconds. |
| `correlate_with_detection`  | `bool`                                        | `False`  | Halve the threshold (floor 1) when the IP has any positive `suspicious_request_counts` entry. |

SecurityConfig.global_behavior_rules
------------------------------------

```python
class SecurityConfig(BaseModel):
    global_behavior_rules: list[BehaviorRuleConfig] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

Every entry runs against every route alongside any decorator-defined rules on that route. Global rules are evaluated by `BehavioralProcessor.process_global_return_rules()` (for `return_pattern`) and the same usage/frequency tracker the decorator rules use.

___

Detection-correlation semantics
-------------------------------

When `correlate_with_detection=True`, the rule's effective threshold is halved (with a floor of 1) for any IP that has any positive entry in `suspicious_request_counts`. The original threshold applies to clean IPs.

Concretely, an IP that has triggered any regex hit at least once will hit the threshold twice as fast. The audit log marks the event with `correlation=True` and the contributing categories (`correlated_categories=[...]`).

___

404-noise correlation example
-----------------------------

A canonical use is global 404 tracking that bans probes faster when they have already tripped a regex:

```python
from guard_core.models import BehaviorRuleConfig, SecurityConfig

config = SecurityConfig(
    global_behavior_rules=[
        BehaviorRuleConfig(
            rule_type="return_pattern",
            threshold=20,
            window=300,
            pattern="status:404",
            action="ban",
            ban_duration=3600,
            correlate_with_detection=True,
        ),
    ],
)
```

A clean IP that hits 20 unique 404s in 5 minutes is banned for 1 hour. An IP that already triggered (e.g.) one `recon` regex match is banned after 10 404s in the same window.
