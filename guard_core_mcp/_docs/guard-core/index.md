`guard-core` is the **framework-agnostic security engine** that provides IP control, rate limiting, penetration detection, security headers, and behavioral analysis through a protocol-based architecture. It is designed to be consumed by **framework-specific adapters** -- not directly by end users.

```

Adapter developers implement three protocols -- `GuardRequest`, `GuardResponse`, and `GuardResponseFactory` -- to bridge their framework's native objects into `guard-core`'s security pipeline. Everything else (17 security checks, the detection engine, Redis state management, event telemetry) works out of the box.

What it's useful for
--------------------

It catches the HTTP-layer attacks an automated, AI-orchestrated attacker runs at scale:

- **Polymorphic payloads** — variation-based SQLi/XSS that defeats signature WAFs (token-overlap scoring catches them)
- **Reconnaissance** — endpoint enumeration, 404 spam, honeypot probing, banner grabbing
- **Distributed attacks** — when paired with behavioral patterns enabled (per-IP rate limits alone are not enough)
- **Known bad actors** — country/cloud/tor blocking, IP reputation
- **Layer-7 abuse** — auto-ban thresholds, custom rate limits per route, CORS enforcement, security headers

It does **not** cover prompt injection against LLM endpoints, model-output exfiltration, application-logic vulnerabilities (auth bypass, IDOR, business-logic flaws), or network-layer DDoS — those are out-of-scope by design and belong to other layers of your stack.

If you're integrating into FastAPI, jump straight to the [**fastapi-guard Integration Guide**](https://rennf93.github.io/fastapi-guard/latest/tutorial/integration/) — it has the decision tree across standalone / SaaS / encrypted-SaaS paths and the common pitfalls.

Key Design Properties
---------------------

- **Protocol-based contracts**: `GuardRequest`, `GuardResponse`, and `GuardResponseFactory` are `typing.Protocol` classes with `@runtime_checkable`. Your adapter implements them; guard-core consumes them.
- **17 security checks in a chain-of-responsibility pipeline**: Each check is an independent `SecurityCheck` subclass. The `SecurityCheckPipeline` executes them in order and short-circuits on the first blocking response.
- **Dependency injection via context dataclasses**: Every core module receives its dependencies through a typed context object (`ResponseContext`, `RoutingContext`, `ValidationContext`, `BypassContext`, `BehavioralContext`).
- **Singleton handlers with async initialization**: `ip_ban_manager`, `cloud_handler`, `rate_limit_handler`, `sus_patterns_handler`, and `redis_handler` are module-level singletons initialized through `HandlerInitializer`.
- **Detection engine**: Regex-based and semantic attack pattern detection with configurable thresholds, timeouts, and content length limits.
- **Redis-backed distributed state**: Rate limits, IP bans, cloud IP ranges, and suspicious pattern counts persist across instances when Redis is enabled. Falls back to in-memory storage automatically.
- **Event system**: `SecurityEventBus` dispatches security events and `MetricsCollector` tracks request metrics, both feeding into the optional guard-agent telemetry platform.
