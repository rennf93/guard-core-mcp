Architecture Overview
=====================

guard-core is a framework-agnostic security engine. Adapter libraries (fastapi-guard, flaskapi-guard, djapi-guard) bridge their framework's native request/response types into guard-core's protocol contracts, then delegate all security logic to the engine.

This document covers the ecosystem architecture, module map, request lifecycle, and the design principles that govern how everything fits together.

Ecosystem Architecture
----------------------

```mermaid
graph TD
    APP["End-User Application"]
    ADAPTER["Framework Adapter"]
    ENGINE["guard-core Engine"]
    EXTERNAL["External Services"]

    APP --> ADAPTER
    ADAPTER --> ENGINE
    ENGINE --> EXTERNAL
```

The adapter is the **only layer** that knows about the web framework. guard-core never imports FastAPI, Flask, Django, or any other framework.

Module Map
----------

### `guard_core/protocols/`

The contract layer. All types here are `typing.Protocol` classes decorated with `@runtime_checkable`.

| Module | Protocol | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `request_protocol.py` | `GuardRequest` | Abstraction over native HTTP request objects |
| `response_protocol.py` | `GuardResponse` | Abstraction over native HTTP response objects |
| `response_protocol.py` | `GuardResponseFactory` | Factory for creating response objects |
| `middleware_protocol.py` | `GuardMiddlewareProtocol` | What the middleware instance must expose to checks |
| `geo_ip_protocol.py` | `GeoIPHandler` | GeoIP lookup interface |
| `redis_protocol.py` | `RedisHandlerProtocol` | Redis operations interface |
| `agent_protocol.py` | `AgentHandlerProtocol` | Telemetry agent interface |

### `guard_core/core/`

The engine internals, organized into 8 sub-modules:

| Sub-module | Components | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `checks/` | `SecurityCheck`, `SecurityCheckPipeline`, 17 check implementations | Chain-of-responsibility security pipeline |
| `events/` | `SecurityEventBus`, `MetricsCollector` | Event dispatching and metrics collection |
| `initialization/` | `HandlerInitializer` | Redis, agent, and handler wiring |
| `responses/` | `ErrorResponseFactory`, `ResponseContext` | Error responses, HTTPS redirects, security headers, CORS |
| `routing/` | `RouteConfigResolver`, `RoutingContext` | Route-level configuration and decorator resolution |
| `validation/` | `RequestValidator`, `ValidationContext` | HTTPS detection, proxy trust, time windows, path exclusion |
| `bypass/` | `BypassHandler`, `BypassContext` | Passthrough and security bypass cases |
| `behavioral/` | `BehavioralProcessor`, `BehavioralContext` | Usage tracking and return-pattern behavioral rules |

### `guard_core/handlers/`

Singleton handler instances that manage stateful operations:

| Handler | Singleton | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `redis_handler.py` | `redis_handler` | Redis connection management |
| `ipban_handler.py` | `ip_ban_manager` | IP ban storage and lookup |
| `ratelimit_handler.py` | `rate_limit_handler` | Rate limit tracking |
| `cloud_handler.py` | `cloud_handler` | Cloud provider IP range management |
| `suspatterns_handler.py` | `sus_patterns_handler` | Suspicious pattern tracking and auto-ban |
| `security_headers_handler.py` | `security_headers_manager` | Security header generation |
| `ipinfo_handler.py` | `IPInfoManager` | IPInfo-based GeoIP lookups |
| `behavior_handler.py` | `BehaviorTracker` | Behavioral rule state tracking |
| `dynamic_rule_handler.py` | `DynamicRuleManager` | Dynamic rule updates from agent |

### `guard_core/detection_engine/`

Regex-based and semantic attack pattern detection. Configurable through `SecurityConfig` fields prefixed with `detection_`.

### `guard_core/decorators/`

`BaseSecurityDecorator` and `RouteConfig` provide route-level security configuration. Framework-specific adapters extend `BaseSecurityDecorator` to create decorator APIs native to their framework.

### `guard_core/models.py`

`SecurityConfig` (Pydantic `BaseModel`) is the single configuration object for the entire engine. `DynamicRules` defines the shape of runtime rule updates from the guard-agent platform.

___

Request Lifecycle
-----------------

This is the complete path a request takes through the engine, from the adapter's perspective:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    NATIVE["Native Request"]
    WRAP["1. Wrap into GuardRequest"]
    BYPASS1["2. Handle passthrough"]
    ROUTE["3. Resolve route config"]
    BYPASS2["4. Handle security bypass"]
    PIPELINE["5. Execute security pipeline"]
    BEHAVIORAL["6. Process usage rules"]
    CALLNEXT["7. Call next handler"]
    RESPONSE["8. Process response"]
    GUARD_RESP["GuardResponse"]
    UNWRAP["Unwrap to native response"]

    NATIVE --> WRAP
    WRAP --> BYPASS1
    BYPASS1 -- "None = continue" --> ROUTE
    ROUTE --> BYPASS2
    BYPASS2 -- "None = continue" --> PIPELINE
    PIPELINE -- "None = all passed" --> BEHAVIORAL
    BEHAVIORAL --> CALLNEXT
    CALLNEXT --> RESPONSE
    RESPONSE --> GUARD_RESP
    GUARD_RESP --> UNWRAP
```

!!! important "The adapter orchestrates this flow"
    guard-core provides all the components listed above, but the **adapter's middleware class** is responsible for calling them in the correct order. guard-core does not impose a middleware base class -- it provides building blocks.

___

Design Principles
-----------------

### Protocol-Based Contracts

Every boundary between guard-core and the outside world is defined by a `typing.Protocol`. This means:

- guard-core never imports framework-specific code
- Adapters satisfy protocols through structural subtyping (duck typing with type safety)
- All protocols are `@runtime_checkable`, so `isinstance()` checks work at runtime

### Dependency Injection via Context Objects

Each core module receives its dependencies through a `@dataclass` context object rather than through constructor parameters or global state:

```python
@dataclass
class ResponseContext:
    config: SecurityConfig
    logger: Logger
    metrics_collector: MetricsCollector
    agent_handler: Any | None = None
    guard_decorator: BaseSecurityDecorator | None = None
    response_factory: Any = field(default=None)
```

The adapter constructs these context objects during middleware initialization and passes them to the respective module constructors. This keeps module interfaces explicit and testable.

### Singleton Handlers

Stateful handlers (`ip_ban_manager`, `cloud_handler`, `rate_limit_handler`, `sus_patterns_handler`, `redis_handler`, `security_headers_manager`) are module-level singletons. They are initialized asynchronously through `HandlerInitializer` during the middleware's startup phase:

1. `initialize_redis_handlers()` -- connects Redis and wires it into all handlers
2. `initialize_agent_integrations()` -- starts the agent and wires it into all handlers
3. `initialize_dynamic_rule_manager()` -- sets up dynamic rule polling (if enabled)

### Chain of Responsibility

The `SecurityCheckPipeline` iterates over an ordered list of `SecurityCheck` instances. Each check either returns `None` (pass) or a `GuardResponse` (block). The pipeline short-circuits on the first blocking response.

### Passive Mode

When `SecurityConfig.passive_mode = True`, checks log violations but return `None` instead of blocking responses. This allows deploying guard-core in observation mode before enforcing.

### Fail-Secure by Default

If a security check raises an exception, the pipeline logs the error and blocks the request with an HTTP 500 response (fail-secure) so check bugs surface. `fail_secure` is a standard `SecurityConfig` field (`fail_secure: bool = Field(default=True)`). Setting `fail_secure = False` opts into fail-open behavior, where the pipeline logs the error and falls through to the next check.
