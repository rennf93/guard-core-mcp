Security Pipeline
=================

The security pipeline is the heart of guard-core. It implements the **chain of responsibility** pattern: an ordered list of `SecurityCheck` instances, executed sequentially for every request. The first check that returns a non-`None` response short-circuits the pipeline and blocks the request.

SecurityCheckPipeline
---------------------

**Location**: `guard_core/core/checks/pipeline.py`

```python
class SecurityCheckPipeline:
    def __init__(
        self,
        checks: list[SecurityCheck],
        muted_check_logs: set[str] | None = None,
        *,
        config: SecurityConfig | None = None,
        rebuild_checks: Callable[[], list[SecurityCheck]] | None = None,
    ) -> None:

        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        self._config = config
        self._rebuild_checks = rebuild_checks
        self._built_revision = config.revision if config is not None else None

    async def execute(self, request: GuardRequest) -> GuardResponse | None:
        self._rebuild_if_stale()
        for check in self.checks:
            try:
                response = await check.check(request)
                if response is not None:

        return None
```

### Config-Revision Rebuild

`SecurityConfig` bumps a private, monotonically increasing revision counter on every attribute assignment (an overridden `__setattr__`; the counter itself is a Pydantic `PrivateAttr`, so it never appears in `model_fields`, `model_dump()`, equality, or the constructor). `build_default_pipeline` passes the pipeline the `SecurityConfig` it built from, a closure that reruns `applies_to` over `DEFAULT_CHECK_CLASSES`, and `factory.WATCHED_CONTAINER_FIELDS`. `execute()` calls `_rebuild_if_stale()` first, which compares the config's current revision against the revision the pipeline was last built at; if the revision moved, it rebuilds outright without looking any further. If it did not move, it computes a size signature -- `len()` on each watched container, with `None` counted as `0` and no allocation -- and compares that against the signature recorded at the last build, rebuilding only if that moved too. When neither has moved this is one integer comparison plus a handful of `len()` calls, not a config fingerprint. When either has moved, it calls the closure, reassigns `self.checks` to the freshly filtered list it returns, and records the new revision and signature, so a config mutated -- by whole-value assignment or by mutating one of the watched containers in place -- after the pipeline was built takes effect on the next request instead of staying silently stale.

The watched fields are `blocked_user_agents`, `block_cloud_providers`, and `endpoint_rate_limits` -- every mutable container any `applies_to` predicate reads, and nothing else needs watching: `blocked_countries`/`whitelist_countries` are `frozenset`, every feature flag is a `bool`, and every predicate reads these three containers as `bool(...)` alone, never by content, so a predicate's answer can only change when a container crosses between empty and non-empty, which is exactly what a size signature catches. `blacklist` and `whitelist` are also mutable containers on `SecurityConfig`, but no `applies_to` reads either one -- `IpSecurityCheck` never overrides `applies_to` and is therefore always built regardless of their contents -- so they are correctly absent from the watched set. That set is not a second hardcoded list: `SecurityCheck.container_fields: ClassVar[tuple[str, ...]]` is a class attribute each check declares next to its own `applies_to` (empty by default), and `factory.WATCHED_CONTAINER_FIELDS` is the union of `container_fields` across `DEFAULT_CHECK_CLASSES`, computed once at import time. A predicate that starts reading a new mutable container is watched the moment its check class says so; nothing elsewhere has to change.

The rebuild always constructs a brand-new list and swaps it into `self.checks` with a single attribute assignment rather than mutating the existing list in place, and `execute()`'s `for check in self.checks` loop captures that list reference once, at the start of the call. A request already in flight therefore keeps running against the snapshot it started with even if a concurrent request or the dynamic-rules background task bumps the revision and triggers a rebuild mid-flight.

`_rebuild_if_stale()` captures the revision, the container signature, and `muted_check_logs` from `config` *before* calling the rebuild closure, then publishes all four together with the rebuilt checks under a `threading.Lock` scoped to the publish alone -- never to the closure call itself, so a rebuild storm never serializes the request path. Two callers can still both rebuild redundantly from a similarly-stale read; that costs CPU, not correctness, since whichever caller's publish lands last stamps *its own* captured revision and signature, not whatever the live config has moved to by the time its build finished. A caller that built from stale state can therefore only ever record that it built from stale state -- it can never publish a check list and then stamp it with a revision/signature that makes the pipeline believe it is current when it is not -- so the next call to `_rebuild_if_stale()` sees the mismatch and rebuilds again. Before this guarantee existed, the revision and signature were read from the live `config` *after* the rebuild closure returned rather than captured before it started; that ordering is safe in the async tree, where `_rebuild_if_stale()` contains no `await` and always completes within a single, uninterruptible coroutine turn, but it was a genuine lost-update race in the generated sync tree, whose `DynamicRuleManager` mutates the watched config fields from a real background `threading.Thread`. The steady-state comparison in `_is_stale()` never takes the lock, so the cost of a request that finds nothing stale is unchanged.

A pipeline constructed directly as `SecurityCheckPipeline(checks)` -- the form every adapter and [the testing guide](../adapters/testing.md) use -- has no `config`/`rebuild_checks` reference and so never rebuilds, exactly as it did before this mechanism existed.

**Residual**: `SecurityConfig`'s mutable containers are now fully covered, both by whole-value assignment and by in-place mutation. What remains open is a `RouteConfig` object mutated in place after startup: the six route-driven predicates (`authentication`, `custom_validators`, `referrer`, `request_size_content`, `required_headers`, `time_window`) read route configs that `_collect_route_configs` captures once, at decoration time, through `middleware.guard_decorator`; nothing re-derives that collection or watches it for staleness, so a route config mutated in place after the pipeline was built is not picked up by this mechanism. `enable_dynamic_rules=True` remains the supported escape hatch for the checks it covers regardless.

### Execution Semantics

1. Checks run **sequentially** in insertion order
2. A check returning `None` means "pass -- continue to next check"
3. A check returning a `GuardResponse` means "block -- stop pipeline and return this response"
4. If a check raises an exception, the pipeline catches it and either continues (fail-open) or blocks (fail-secure)
5. If all checks return `None`, the pipeline returns `None`, meaning the request is allowed

### Pipeline Management Methods

| Method | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `execute` | `async (request: GuardRequest) -> GuardResponse \| None` | Run all checks against the request |
| `add_check` | `(check: SecurityCheck) -> None` | Append a check to the end of the pipeline |
| `insert_check` | `(index: int, check: SecurityCheck) -> None` | Insert a check at a specific position |
| `remove_check` | `(check_name: str) -> bool` | Remove a check by name. Returns `True` if found |
| `get_check_names` | `() -> list[str]` | List all check names in execution order |
| `__len__` | `() -> int` | Number of checks in the pipeline |

SecurityCheck Base Class
------------------------

**Location**: `guard_core/core/checks/base.py`

Every security check extends this abstract base class:

```python
class SecurityCheck(ABC):
    requires: ClassVar[tuple[str, ...]] = ()

    def __init__(self, middleware: "GuardMiddlewareProtocol") -> None:
        self.middleware = middleware
        self.config = middleware.config
        self.logger = middleware.logger

    @classmethod
    def applies_to(
        cls,
        config: "SecurityConfig",
        route_configs: "Collection[RouteConfig] | None",
    ) -> bool:
        return True

    @abstractmethod
    async def check(self, request: GuardRequest) -> GuardResponse | None:
        pass

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def check_name(self) -> str:
        pass

    async def send_event(
        self,
        event_type: str,
        request: GuardRequest,
        action_taken: str,
        reason: str,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> None:
        await self.middleware.event_bus.send_middleware_event(
            event_type=event_type,
            request=request,
            action_taken=action_taken,
            reason=reason,
            **kwargs,
        )

    async def create_error_response(
        self, status_code: int, default_message: str
    ) -> GuardResponse:
        return await self.middleware.create_error_response(status_code, default_message)

    def is_passive_mode(self) -> bool:
        return self.config.passive_mode
```

### What a Check Must Implement

| Member | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `check_name` | `@property -> str` | A unique identifier for the check (e.g. `"ip_security"`, `"rate_limit"`) |
| `check(request)` | `async -> GuardResponse \| None` | The check logic. Return `None` to pass, or a `GuardResponse` to block |

### What a Check May Override

| Member | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `applies_to(config, route_configs)` | `@classmethod -> bool` | Returns `True` unconditionally | Declares, at pipeline-build time, whether the effective configuration can ever make this check fire. See [Build-Time Elimination](#build-time-elimination) below. |
| `requires` | `ClassVar[tuple[str, ...]]` | `()` | Names the packaging extra(s) the check's handler needs (for example `("cloud",)` on `CloudProviderCheck`). |

A check that does not override `applies_to` always runs, because the base implementation returns `True`.

### What a Check Gets for Free

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `self.middleware` | Access to the `GuardMiddlewareProtocol` instance (event bus, route resolver, handlers) |
| `self.config` | Direct access to `SecurityConfig` |
| `self.logger` | The middleware's logger |
| `send_event(...)` | Shortcut for `self.middleware.event_bus.send_middleware_event(...)` |
| `create_error_response(status_code, message)` | Shortcut for `self.middleware.create_error_response(...)` |
| `is_passive_mode()` | Whether the engine is in passive (log-only) mode |

Build-Time Elimination
-----------------------

**Location**: `guard_core/core/checks/factory.py`

`build_default_pipeline` filters the 17-check catalogue (`DEFAULT_CHECK_CLASSES`) through each check class's `applies_to(config, route_configs)` classmethod before instantiating anything, so a deployment only builds and runs the checks its configuration can actually trigger:

```python
def _build_checks(
    middleware: "GuardMiddlewareProtocol",
) -> list[SecurityCheck]:
    config = middleware.config
    route_configs = _collect_route_configs(middleware)
    return [
        cls(middleware)
        for cls in DEFAULT_CHECK_CLASSES
        if cls.applies_to(config, route_configs)
    ]


def build_default_pipeline(
    middleware: "GuardMiddlewareProtocol",
) -> SecurityCheckPipeline:
    config = middleware.config
    return SecurityCheckPipeline(
        _build_checks(middleware),
        muted_check_logs=config.muted_check_logs,
        config=config,
        rebuild_checks=lambda: _build_checks(middleware),
    )


def _collect_route_configs(
    middleware: "GuardMiddlewareProtocol",
) -> Collection[RouteConfig] | None:
    decorator = getattr(middleware, "guard_decorator", None)
    if decorator is None:
        return None
    return tuple(decorator._route_configs.values())
```

This filtering happens once, when the pipeline is built (lazily, on the first request, after route registration completes). It does not re-run on every single call to `execute()`: a check's presence in the pipeline reflects the configuration as of the last build, not necessarily the configuration at this exact instant. But it does re-run the moment `execute()` notices the config has moved since that build -- see [Config-Revision Rebuild](#config-revision-rebuild) above -- so mutating `SecurityConfig` after the pipeline exists now does add or remove checks from that pipeline, on the next request through it. `enable_dynamic_rules=True` (see below) remains the way to keep every dynamically-relevant check present regardless of what the rest of the config says; it is not the only way to get a runtime change to take effect, but the revision-triggered rebuild does not replace its narrower guarantee of "these seven checks are always here" with a broader one -- an app that relies on that guarantee for cloud/user-agent/rate-limit checks it might toggle via `DynamicRuleManager` should keep using it.

### The safety rule

Elimination is strictly an optimization, never a security decision. The base `applies_to` implementation returns `True`, so any check that does not override it always runs unconditionally. Every real `applies_to` override in the codebase returns `True` on any uncertainty about the effective configuration or the registered routes -- an unknown state is always treated as "keep the check."

### Unknown route configuration means keep everything

`_collect_route_configs` returns `None`, not an empty tuple, when `middleware.guard_decorator` is `None`, meaning the adapter has no decorator handle to enumerate registered routes from. `None` means "unknown"; an empty tuple means "known to be empty, no route carries a decorator." Every route-driven predicate goes through `route_config_applies()` (`guard_core/core/checks/helpers.py`), which returns `True` immediately when `route_configs is None`:

```python
def route_config_applies(
    route_configs: Collection[RouteConfig] | None,
    predicate: Callable[[RouteConfig], bool],
) -> bool:
    if route_configs is None:
        return True
    for route_config in route_configs:
        if predicate(route_config):
            return True
    return False
```

An adapter that cannot enumerate its routes at pipeline-build time therefore loses the elimination optimization for route-driven checks, never the protection those checks provide.

### `enable_dynamic_rules` keeps every dynamically-mutable check

`DynamicRuleManager` can flip `enable_penetration_detection`, `enable_ip_banning`, `enable_rate_limiting`, `emergency_mode`, `endpoint_rate_limits`, `block_cloud_providers`, and `blocked_user_agents` on a live `SecurityConfig`. Setting `config.enable_dynamic_rules = True` keeps every check whose predicate depends on one of those flags, regardless of every other setting: `emergency_mode`, `cloud_ip_refresh`, `cloud_provider`, `user_agent`, `rate_limit`, and `suspicious_activity` each OR `config.enable_dynamic_rules` directly into their predicate. `ip_security` does not need to, because it is never eliminated at all, for the reason below -- so all seven checks a running deployment might turn on through dynamic rules stay in the pipeline once `enable_dynamic_rules=True` is set, whatever the rest of the configuration says.

### `IpSecurityCheck` is never eliminated

`IpSecurityCheck` has no `applies_to` override, so it inherits the base's unconditional `True`. This is deliberate, not an oversight. `check()` calls `_check_banned_ip` first, which calls `ip_ban_manager.is_ip_banned()` unconditionally, gated only by a per-route `should_bypass_check("ip_ban", route_config)` decorator, never by `SecurityConfig.enable_ip_banning`. IPs reach that ban store from `BehaviorTracker._execute_ban_action`, which bans through `ip_ban_manager.ban_ip()` regardless of `enable_ip_banning`, and from any other process sharing the same Redis-backed ban store. No `SecurityConfig` can prove the check unreachable, so it is always built.

### Per-check predicates

| Check | Kept when | Default verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `route_config` | Always (no override; produces `client_ip`, `route_config`) | keep |
| `emergency_mode` | `config.emergency_mode` or `enable_dynamic_rules` | drop |
| `https_enforcement` | `config.enforce_https` or any route requires HTTPS | drop |
| `request_logging` | `config.log_request_level is not None` | drop |
| `request_size_content` | Any route sets `max_request_size` or `allowed_content_types` | drop |
| `required_headers` | Any route sets `required_headers` | drop |
| `authentication` | Any route sets `auth_required` | drop |
| `referrer` | Any route sets `require_referrer` | drop |
| `custom_validators` | Any route sets `custom_validators` | drop |
| `time_window` | Any route sets `time_restrictions` | drop |
| `cloud_ip_refresh` | `config.block_cloud_providers` is set, any route sets `block_cloud_providers`, or `enable_dynamic_rules` | drop |
| `ip_security` | Always (no override, see above) | keep |
| `cloud_provider` | `config.block_cloud_providers` is set, any route sets `block_cloud_providers`, or `enable_dynamic_rules` | drop |
| `user_agent` | `config.blocked_user_agents` is non-empty, any route sets `blocked_user_agents`, or `enable_dynamic_rules` | drop |
| `rate_limit` | `config.enable_rate_limiting`, `config.endpoint_rate_limits` is set, any route sets `rate_limit`/`geo_rate_limits`, or `enable_dynamic_rules` | keep (`enable_rate_limiting` defaults to `True`) |
| `suspicious_activity` | `config.enable_penetration_detection`, any route sets `enable_suspicious_detection`, or `enable_dynamic_rules` | keep (`enable_penetration_detection` defaults to `True`) |
| `custom_request` | `config.custom_request_check is not None` | drop |

"Any route sets X" is `False` when `route_configs` is a known-empty tuple and always `True` when `route_configs is None` (unknown, see above). A default `SecurityConfig()` with no route decorators builds exactly four checks: `route_config`, `ip_security`, `rate_limit`, `suspicious_activity`. Configuring every feature and providing a fully-populated route decorator builds all 17, in the order shown below.

___

All 17 Checks in Execution Order
---------------------------------

The checks are listed here in the fixed order the catalogue defines. This order matters -- earlier checks set up state that later checks depend on. A given deployment's pipeline is a subset of this list, filtered by `applies_to` as described above, but the checks that do build always run in this relative order.

### 1. RouteConfigCheck

| | |
|---|---|
| **check_name** | `route_config` |
| **Module** | `guard_core.core.checks.implementations.route_config` |
| **Purpose** | Resolves the route-level decorator configuration and extracts the client IP |
| **Blocks?** | Only under `route_resolution_strict`, when the adapter reports it could not resolve the route -- `500 Route resolution failed` |
| **Side Effects** | Sets `request.state.route_config` and `request.state.client_ip` |

This check runs first because all subsequent checks depend on `request.state.client_ip` and `request.state.route_config`.

### 2. EmergencyModeCheck

| | |
|---|---|
| **check_name** | `emergency_mode` |
| **Module** | `guard_core.core.checks.implementations.emergency_mode` |
| **Purpose** | Blocks all requests when `config.emergency_mode = True`, except IPs in `config.emergency_whitelist` |
| **Blocks?** | Returns 503 for non-whitelisted IPs (unless passive mode) |

### 3. HttpsEnforcementCheck

| | |
|---|---|
| **check_name** | `https_enforcement` |
| **Module** | `guard_core.core.checks.implementations.https_enforcement` |
| **Purpose** | Redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS when `config.enforce_https = True` or route requires HTTPS |

| **Module** | `guard_core.core.checks.implementations.request_logging` |
| **Purpose** | Logs the incoming request if `config.log_request_level` is set |
| **Blocks?** | Never. Always returns `None` |

### 5. RequestSizeContentCheck

| | |
|---|---|
| **check_name** | `request_size_content` |
| **Module** | `guard_core.core.checks.implementations.request_size_content` |
| **Purpose** | Validates request body size and content type against route-level `max_request_size` and `allowed_content_types` |
| **Blocks?** | Returns 413 (payload too large) or 415 (unsupported media type) |

### 6. RequiredHeadersCheck

| | |
|---|---|
| **check_name** | `required_headers` |
| **Module** | `guard_core.core.checks.implementations.required_headers` |
| **Purpose** | Validates that required headers are present with expected values (from route config) |
| **Blocks?** | Returns 400 (bad request) |

### 7. AuthenticationCheck

| | |
|---|---|
| **check_name** | `authentication` |
| **Module** | `guard_core.core.checks.implementations.authentication` |
| **Purpose** | Validates authentication headers (Bearer, Basic, custom) based on route config |

| **Module** | `guard_core.core.checks.implementations.referrer` |
| **Purpose** | Validates the `Referer` header against route-level allowed domains |
| **Blocks?** | Returns 403 (forbidden) |

### 9. CustomValidatorsCheck

| | |
|---|---|
| **check_name** | `custom_validators` |
| **Module** | `guard_core.core.checks.implementations.custom_validators` |

### 10. TimeWindowCheck

| | |
|---|---|
| **check_name** | `time_window` |
| **Module** | `guard_core.core.checks.implementations.time_window` |
| **Purpose** | Enforces time-of-day access restrictions from route config |
| **Blocks?** | Returns 403 (forbidden) |

### 11. CloudIpRefreshCheck

| | |
|---|---|
| **check_name** | `cloud_ip_refresh` |
| **Module** | `guard_core.core.checks.implementations.cloud_ip_refresh` |
| **Purpose** | Periodically refreshes cloud provider IP ranges based on `config.cloud_ip_refresh_interval` |
| **Blocks?** | Never. Always returns `None` |
| **Side Effects** | Schedules a single-flight background refresh (running `middleware.refresh_cloud_ip_ranges()` off the request path) when the interval has elapsed |

| **Purpose** | Filters requests by user agent string against route-level and global blocklists |
| **Blocks?** | Returns 403 (forbidden) |

### 15. RateLimitCheck

| | |
|---|---|
| **check_name** | `rate_limit` |
| **Module** | `guard_core.core.checks.implementations.rate_limit` |
| **Purpose** | Enforces rate limits at four levels: endpoint-specific, route-level, geo-based, and global |
| **Blocks?** | Returns 429 (too many requests) |

!!! note "Rate limit evaluation order"
    The rate limit check evaluates in this priority: endpoint rate limits (from dynamic rules) > route rate limits (from decorators) > geo rate limits (from decorators) > global rate limit (from config). The first limit that is exceeded blocks the request.

### 16. SuspiciousActivityCheck

| | |
|---|---|
| **check_name** | `suspicious_activity` |
| **Module** | `guard_core.core.checks.implementations.suspicious_activity` |
| **Purpose** | Runs penetration attempt detection against the request URL, headers, query params, and body. Tracks suspicious request counts for auto-ban |
| **Blocks?** | Returns 403 (forbidden) |

### 17. CustomRequestCheck

Fail-Open vs Fail-Secure
-------------------------

By default, the pipeline is **fail-secure**: if a security check raises an unhandled exception, the pipeline logs the error and blocks the request with an HTTP 500 response so check bugs surface instead of silently passing requests through.

```python
except Exception as e:
    self.logger.error(...)

    if check.config.fail_secure:
        return await check.create_error_response(
            status_code=500,
            default_message="Security check failed",
        )

    continue
```

`fail_secure` is a standard field on the `SecurityConfig` model (`fail_secure: bool = Field(default=True)`). When `True` (the default), any check exception results in a 500 response, blocking the request. Setting `fail_secure = False` opts into fail-open behavior: the pipeline logs the error and falls through to the next check.

!!! tip "Choosing a failure mode"
    Keep fail-secure (the default) in production so check bugs surface as 500s rather than letting unchecked requests through. Set `fail_secure = False` to opt into fail-open behavior, intended only for staging diagnostics where availability is preferred over blocking on a check error.

### Rebuild Failures

`execute()` now wraps the call to `_rebuild_if_stale()` in its own `try`/`except`, ahead of and separate from the one already wrapping each check, so a raising rebuild closure -- a check constructor failing during initialization, for instance -- is routed through the same `fail_secure` decision a check exception gets, not left to propagate out of `execute()` uncaught. Under `fail_secure=True` (the default), a rebuild failure blocks the request with the same 500 `Security check failed` response a failing check produces, built through the still-valid last-known-good `self.checks[0]`'s middleware; a pipeline that has no known-good check at all to build a response through re-raises the original exception instead of silently falling open. Under `fail_secure=False`, the error is logged and the request continues against the last known-good `self.checks` -- the check list the pipeline already knew to be correct before the failed rebuild attempt, not a partially-rebuilt or truncated one, since `self.checks` is only ever reassigned after the rebuild closure returns successfully. Neither path updates the revision/signature bookkeeping on failure, so a transient rebuild failure -- a check constructor that fails once and then succeeds, for example -- is retried, and recovers, on the very next request instead of wedging the pipeline into raising (or silently degrading) forever.

___

Passive Mode
------------

When `SecurityConfig.passive_mode = True`, checks still evaluate fully and log violations, but they return `None` instead of a blocking `GuardResponse`. This is implemented at the individual check level:

```python
if not self.config.passive_mode:
    return await self.middleware.create_error_response(
        status_code=403,
        default_message="Forbidden",
    )

return None
```

Each check is responsible for honoring passive mode. The base class provides `is_passive_mode()` as a convenience method.

Adding a Custom Security Check
-------------------------------

To add a new check, create a class extending `SecurityCheck`, then register it in the pipeline.

### Step 1: Create the Check

```python
from guard_core.core.checks.base import SecurityCheck
from guard_core.protocols.request_protocol import GuardRequest
from guard_core.protocols.response_protocol import GuardResponse


class ApiKeyCheck(SecurityCheck):
    @property
    def check_name(self) -> str:
        return "api_key"

    async def check(self, request: GuardRequest) -> GuardResponse | None:
        api_key = request.headers.get("X-API-Key")
        if not api_key:
            await self.send_event(
                event_type="authentication_failed",
                request=request,
                action_taken="request_blocked"
                if not self.is_passive_mode()
                else "logged_only",
                reason="Missing API key",
            )

            if not self.is_passive_mode():
                return await self.create_error_response(
                    status_code=401,
                    default_message="API key required",
                )

        return None
```

### Step 2: Register in the Pipeline

In your adapter's middleware, after building the default pipeline, add the check:

```python
from guard_core.core.checks import build_default_pipeline

pipeline = build_default_pipeline(middleware)

pipeline.add_check(ApiKeyCheck(middleware))

pipeline.insert_check(7, ApiKeyCheck(middleware))
```

### Step 3: (Optional) Make It Removable

Other code can remove your check by name:

```python
pipeline.remove_check("api_key")
```

### Guidelines

- Always honor `self.is_passive_mode()` in your blocking logic
- Use `self.send_event(...)` to emit telemetry for agent integration
- Use `self.create_error_response(...)` instead of constructing responses directly -- this applies custom error messages, security headers, and response modifiers
- Access shared state through `self.middleware` (e.g. `self.middleware.rate_limit_handler`, `self.middleware.geo_ip_handler`)
- Read per-request state from `request.state` (e.g. `request.state.client_ip`, `request.state.route_config`)
