SecurityConfig Reference
========================

`SecurityConfig` is a Pydantic `BaseModel` that controls all guard-core behavior. Adapter developers should expose relevant fields to their users while keeping internal fields (agent, dynamic rules) as implementation details.

Core Settings
-------------

| Field                     | Type                        | Default  | Description                                            |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `passive_mode`            | `bool`                      | `False`  | Log-only mode. Logs and emits events but never blocks. |
| `exclude_paths`           | `list[str]`                 | See below| Paths that skip detection and behavioral analysis; ban enforcement and rate limiting still apply. See [Ban Configuration](../api/ban-config.md#exclude_paths-enforces-bans-and-rate-limits-not-evidence-gathering). |
| `custom_error_responses`  | `dict[int, str]`            | `{}`     | Override error messages for specific HTTP status codes. |
| `enforce_https`           | `bool`                      | `False`  | Redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS globally.              |
| `custom_request_check`    | `Callable \| None`          | `None`   | Global async function for custom request validation.   |
| `custom_response_modifier`| `Callable \| None`          | `None`   | Global async function to modify responses.             |
| `route_resolution_strict` | `bool`                      | `False`  | Block with `500` when the adapter reports it could not resolve the route, instead of running the pipeline with no per-route config. Also turns requests to paths the app does not serve into `500`s rather than `404`s. See [Reporting a Failed Match](../adapters/decorators.md#reporting-a-failed-match). |
| `on_error`                | `Callable[[str, BaseException, dict], None] \| None` | `None` | Best-effort callback invoked when a middleware/agent step fails, receiving `(stage, exception, context)`. `stage` is one of `agent_init`, `geoip`, `transport_send`, `encryption`. Also forwarded to `AgentConfig.on_error` when the agent is enabled; see [Agent / Telemetry](#agent-telemetry). |

**Default `exclude_paths`**: `["/docs", "/redoc", "/openapi.json", "/openapi.yaml", "/favicon.ico", "/static"]`

!!! tip "Adapter Exposure"
    All core settings should be exposed to end users. `passive_mode` is particularly useful for deployment rollouts.

Proxy Configuration
-------------------

| Field                     | Type         | Default  | Description                                            |
|---------------------------|-------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `trusted_proxies`         | `tuple[str, ...]` | `()`     | Trusted proxy IPs or CIDR ranges for X-Forwarded-For.  |
| `trusted_proxy_depth`     | `int`       | `1`      | Number of proxies in the X-Forwarded-For chain.        |
| `trust_x_forwarded_proto` | `bool`      | `False`  | Trust X-Forwarded-Proto header for HTTPS detection.    |

**Validators**:

- `trusted_proxies`: Each entry is validated as a valid IP address or CIDR range, or the literal string `"unix"`, which marks a peer-less connection (no `request.client_host`, e.g. a Unix domain socket) as a trusted hop so `X-Forwarded-For` still resolves the real client. `whitelist` and `blacklist` do not accept `"unix"`.
- `trusted_proxies`: if any entry is a `/0` network (`0.0.0.0/0` or `::/0`), construction logs a `WARNING` naming the risk (every peer becomes trusted to set `X-Forwarded-For`); the literal `"unix"` token is exempt from this check.
- `trusted_proxy_depth`: Must be >= 1.

`trusted_proxy_depth` is the number of hops you vouch for, not a maximum: the connecting peer must itself be listed in `trusted_proxies`. A chain shorter than the configured depth, or a depth-selected entry that is itself a trusted proxy, now logs a one-time `WARNING` (see [Unsatisfiable and Over-Counted Depth](../internals/ip-management.md#unsatisfiable-and-over-counted-depth)).

!!! warning "Your app server must not pre-resolve the client itself"
    Leaving `trusted_proxies` unset only means "`X-Forwarded-For` is never trusted" if your ASGI/WSGI server isn't already applying that header before guard-core runs. uvicorn's default `proxy_headers=True` (and equivalent settings in Gunicorn/Hypercorn) does exactly that. See [Deployment Prerequisite](../internals/ip-management.md#deployment-prerequisite-disable-the-app-servers-own-forwarded-header-handling) for the fix.

IP Management
-------------

| Field                | Type              | Default           | Description                                    |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `whitelist`          | `tuple[str, ...] \| None` | `None`          | Allowed IPs/CIDRs. `None` disables (allow all).|
| `blacklist`          | `tuple[str, ...]`       | `()`              | Blocked IPs/CIDRs.                             |
| `whitelist_countries`| `frozenset[str]`       | `frozenset()`              | Allowed countries. Non-empty = only listed pass (unknown blocked). Overrides `blocked_countries`. |
| `blocked_countries`  | `frozenset[str]`       | `frozenset()`              | Country codes always blocked.                  |
| `blocked_user_agents`| `list[str]`       | `[]`              | Regex patterns for blocked user agents.        |
| `enable_ip_banning`  | `bool`            | `True`            | Enable automatic IP banning.                   |
| `auto_ban_threshold` | `int`             | `10`              | Suspicious requests before auto-ban (`>= 1`).  |
| `auto_ban_duration`  | `int`             | `3600`            | Ban duration in seconds (`>= 1`).              |

**Validators**:

- `whitelist` and `blacklist`: Each entry validated as a valid IP or CIDR range via `ipaddress.ip_address()` / `ip_network()`.

!!! warning "Whitelist Semantics"
    `whitelist=None` means "no whitelist" (all IPs pass). `whitelist=[]` means "empty whitelist" (no IPs pass). Adapter developers should document this distinction.

___

Per-Category Bans
-----------------

`threat_ban_config` lets each detection category carry its own threshold and duration. The pipeline tracks per-category counts in `suspicious_request_counts`, then walks the matched categories of the current detection. The first category whose own count reaches its `threshold` triggers a category-tagged ban; if no per-category entry matches, the flat `auto_ban_threshold` / `auto_ban_duration` fallback fires off the *total* count instead.

| Field                | Type                              | Default | Description                                          |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `threat_ban_config`  | `MappingProxyType[str, ThreatBanConfig]`      | `mappingproxy({})`    | Per-category ban policy. Validator rejects unknown keys. |

When to use:

- You want SQL injection detections to be a single-strike ban for a week, but XSS detections to be a 3-strike ban for an hour.
- You want to keep the existing flat threshold for any category you do not name.
- You want the audit log reasons to disambiguate which category triggered the ban (`"penetration_attempt:sqli"` vs the flat `"penetration_attempt"`).

```python
from guard_core.models import SecurityConfig, ThreatBanConfig

config = SecurityConfig(
    auto_ban_threshold=10,
    auto_ban_duration=3600,
    threat_ban_config={
        "sqli": ThreatBanConfig(threshold=1, duration=604800),
        "xss": ThreatBanConfig(threshold=3, duration=86400),
    },
)
```

See [Ban Configuration](../api/ban-config.md) for the `ThreatBanConfig` model and the full fall-through rule.

___

Global Behavior Rules
---------------------

`global_behavior_rules` applies behavior rules to every route without requiring decorators. The merged rules are run alongside any decorator-specified rules. The most common use is service-wide 404-noise correlation, but the same shape supports `usage`, `frequency`, and `return_pattern` rules.

| Field                                        | Type                          | Default    | Description                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `global_behavior_rules`                        | `tuple[BehaviorRuleConfig, ...]` | `()`    | Behavior rules merged into every route. Immutable: reassign the whole field to change it, `.append()` raises `AttributeError`. |
| `behavior_scan_response_body`                  | `bool`                        | `False`    | Read response bodies to evaluate `return_pattern` rules whose pattern is not `status:` (`json:`, `regex:`, or a bare substring). Off by default: no response body is ever read for pattern matching, and constructing a `return_pattern` rule with a non-`status:` pattern while this is `False` raises `ValueError` instead of silently accepting a rule that can never match. `status:` patterns match on `status_code` alone and are unaffected. |
| `behavior_max_response_body_inspect_bytes`     | `int`                         | `262144`   | Maximum bytes read from the start of a response body and held for `return_pattern` inspection when `behavior_scan_response_body` is `True`. Bounds what guard-core retains, not what the application produces; a streaming response stays streaming to the client. See [Protocols - BoundedResponseBodyReader](../api/protocols.md#boundedresponsebodyreader). |
| `body_read_timeout`                            | `float`                       | `3.0`      | Seconds to wait for an adapter's `read_body_prefix`/`body` call before giving up. Bounds the request-body detection read and the response-body behaviour-rule read against a stalled or misbehaving adapter/stream; on timeout the body is treated as unavailable, the same fail-closed outcome already used when the adapter raises. The async `guard_core` tree bounds the wait via `asyncio.wait_for`. The sync tree (`guard_core.sync`) cannot cancel a blocking call from the outside, so each read attempt runs on its own daemon thread and this value bounds how long the caller joins that thread instead; see `sync_body_read_max_concurrent` for the concurrent-thread budget. |

When to use:

- You want a global "ban after 20 404s in 5 minutes" rule that does not require touching every route.
- You want detection-correlated thresholds — `correlate_with_detection=True` halves the threshold (floor 1) when the IP has any positive `suspicious_request_counts` entry, so probing that already triggered a regex hit gets banned faster.
- You want a service-wide frequency or usage cap for any caller, regardless of which route they hit.

```python
from guard_core.models import BehaviorRuleConfig, SecurityConfig

config = SecurityConfig(
    global_behavior_rules=[
        BehaviorRuleConfig(
            rule_type="return_pattern",
            threshold=20,
            window=300,
            pattern="status:404",
            action="ban",
            ban_duration=3600,
            correlate_with_detection=True,
        ),
    ],
)
```

A `json:`, `regex:`, or bare-substring pattern additionally requires `behavior_scan_response_body=True` and an adapter that implements `BoundedResponseBodyReader`; without both, construction rejects the rule outright rather than accepting one that can never match:

```python
config = SecurityConfig(
    behavior_scan_response_body=True,
    behavior_max_response_body_inspect_bytes=65536,
    global_behavior_rules=[
        BehaviorRuleConfig(
            rule_type="return_pattern",
            threshold=5,
            window=300,
            pattern="json:error.code==AUTH_FAIL",
            action="ban",
        ),
    ],
)
```

See [Behavior Rules](../api/behavior-rules.md) for the full field reference.

Detection Exclusions
--------------------

These fields opt request components out of penetration detection. The header set is merged with a hardcoded default that already excludes `host`, `user-agent`, `accept`, `accept-encoding`, `connection`, `origin`, `referer`, all `sec-fetch-*`, and all `sec-ch-ua*` headers. `enabled_detection_categories` narrows the regex scan to a subset of the 18 known categories; custom user patterns always run regardless. An empty `enabled_detection_categories` while `enable_penetration_detection` is `True` logs a `WARNING` at construction: detection would run on every request but never match anything.

| Field                              | Type        | Default                          | Description                                                                |
|------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `excluded_detection_headers`       | `set[str]`  | `set()`                          | Header names skipped by detection. Merged with the hardcoded default list. |
| `excluded_detection_params`        | `set[str]`  | `set()`                          | Query parameter names skipped by detection.                                |
| `excluded_detection_body_fields`   | `set[str]`  | `set()`                          | Top-level JSON body keys skipped by detection.                             |
| `enabled_detection_categories`     | `frozenset[str]`  | full `ALL_DETECTION_CATEGORIES`  | Categories scanned for. Validator rejects unknown labels.                  |

When to use:

- A first-party endpoint accepts JSON containing literals (Markdown source, code blobs, URL-shaped query params) that look like attacks but are not.
- A regression in one category's regex is producing false positives faster than you can write a fix — disable the category temporarily.
- A privacy-sensitive header value should not be scanned at all.
- You want different routes to have different opt-outs — pair this with `@security.detection_exclusion(...)` on the route.

```python
from guard_core.models import SecurityConfig

config = SecurityConfig(
    excluded_detection_params={"q", "search", "filter"},
    excluded_detection_body_fields={"description", "markdown"},
    enabled_detection_categories={"sqli", "xss", "cmd_injection", "ssrf"},
)
```

IP Lifecycle Controls
---------------------

These fields tune cold-start and horizontal-scale behaviour for the geo-IP and cloud-IP subsystems. They are inert by default — only adjust if you have a specific cold-start or scale-out problem.

| Field                | Type                            | Default | Description                                                                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `lazy_init`          | `bool`                          | `True`  | When `True` (default), run the IPInfo MMDB download and cloud-IP provider fetches as a background task during startup instead of awaiting them inline, so app boot never blocks on multi-second network calls. Cloud and geo layers are inert until the task completes. Set to `False` to await them inline for synchronous-init guarantees. |
| `geo_ip_db_max_age`  | `int`                           | `86400` | Maximum age in seconds for the IPInfo MMDB before re-download. Range 3600 - 604800. |
| `cloud_ip_store`     | `CloudIpStoreProtocol \| None`  | `None`  | Pluggable cloud-IP backend. `None` uses the in-memory default; auto-upgraded to Redis when Redis is enabled. |

When to use:

- `lazy_init=True` to keep startup non-blocking when IPInfo MMDB or cloud-IP provider fetches are slow. The background warmup runs concurrently with normal request handling; cloud-provider blocking and geo checks become active once the background task finishes. Rate limiting, IP banning, pattern detection, and other layers remain fully active throughout the warmup window. `lazy_init` only takes effect when Redis is enabled and the adapter calls `initialize_redis_handlers()` from its own startup hook (for example fastapi-guard's lifespan integration) — see [Provider Status](#provider-status) below for the accessor that lets a Kubernetes/ALB warmup probe (or any health endpoint) tell when that window has closed.
- `geo_ip_db_max_age` to tighten or loosen the IPInfo refresh cadence — match it to your IPInfo plan's update frequency.
- `cloud_ip_store` to point multiple horizontally-scaled instances at a single pre-populated Redis namespace, skipping per-instance cloud-IP cold starts.

```python
from guard_core.handlers.cloud_ip_stores import RedisCloudIpStore
from guard_core.handlers.redis_handler import RedisManager
from guard_core.models import SecurityConfig

config = SecurityConfig(
    lazy_init=True,
    geo_ip_db_max_age=43200,
)

shared_store = RedisCloudIpStore(RedisManager(config))
config_with_shared_store = SecurityConfig(cloud_ip_store=shared_store)
```

### Provider Status

`cloud_handler.get_status()` (the module-level singleton) and your `IPInfoManager` instance's `get_status()` report per-provider readiness, the last successful refresh timestamp, and a cheap entry count. `HandlerInitializer` is adapter-internal — its `get_initialization_status()` combines both into one payload, and adapters expose that combined payload as their status surface (fastapi-guard: `SecurityMiddleware.get_initialization_status()`, or `add_status_route(app)` → `GET /_guard/status`).

Cloud-only status, callable anywhere:

```python
from guard_core.handlers.cloud_handler import cloud_handler

cloud_status = cloud_handler.get_status()
# {
#     "AWS": {"ready": True, "last_refreshed": datetime(...), "entries": 3421},
#     "GCP": {"ready": False, "last_refreshed": None, "entries": 0},
#     ...
# }
```

Geo-IP status — call `get_status()` on the `IPInfoManager` instance you passed in as `geo_ip_handler` (there is no module singleton: the manager is token-gated, so it is instantiated per app, not at import time):

```python
geo_status = ip_info_manager.get_status()
# {"ready": True, "last_refreshed": datetime(...), "entries": 494}
```

Combined cloud + geo-IP payload, for a warmup probe or health endpoint — read it through your adapter rather than reconstructing `HandlerInitializer` yourself (fastapi-guard):

```python
from guard.status import add_status_route

add_status_route(app, path="/_guard/status")  # GET /_guard/status -> combined payload
# or, in-process: security_middleware.get_initialization_status()
# {
#     "cloud_providers": { ...as above... },
#     "geo_ip": { ...as above... },
# }
```

`geo_ip` is `None` when no `geo_ip_handler` is configured. A custom `geo_ip_handler` that does not implement `get_status()` still reports `ready` (from the required `is_initialized` property) with `last_refreshed`/`entries` as placeholders. This is synchronous, dependency-free, and cheap enough to poll from a warmup probe or health endpoint — it is exactly what to wire up for the "cannot tolerate any inert window" case above.

See [Cloud IP Store](../api/cloud-ip-store.md) for the protocol contract and the Redis namespace migration note.

Geolocation
-----------

| Field              | Type              | Default | Description                                         |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `geo_ip_handler`   | `GeoIPHandler \| None` | `None`  | Custom geolocation handler implementing the protocol.|
| `ipinfo_token`     | `str \| None`     | `None`  | **Deprecated.** IPInfo API token.                   |
| `ipinfo_db_path`   | `Path \| None`    | `data/ipinfo/country_asn.mmdb` | **Deprecated.** Path to IPInfo database. |

**Model validator**: If `blocked_countries` or `whitelist_countries` are set, `geo_ip_handler` must be provided (or `ipinfo_token` for backward compatibility). Raises `ValueError` otherwise.

___

Rate Limiting
-------------

| Field                 | Type             | Default | Description                                        |
|-----------------------|------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `enable_rate_limiting`| `bool`           | `True`  | Master switch for rate limiting.                   |
| `rate_limit`          | `int`            | `10`    | Maximum requests per window (global).              |
| `rate_limit_window`   | `int`            | `60`    | Window duration in seconds (global).               |
| `endpoint_rate_limits`| `dict[str, tuple[int, int]]` | `{}` | Per-endpoint overrides `{path: (limit, window)}`. |
| `enable_rate_limit_auto_ban` | `bool`     | `False` | Feed rate-limit violations into the same auto-ban engine penetration detection uses. Requires `enable_ip_banning` to actually ban; off by default, so this is zero behavior change unless enabled. |

`enable_rate_limit_auto_ban` reuses the [Per-Category Bans](#per-category-bans) machinery: each active-mode (non-passive) rate-limit violation increments the `rate_limit` category of `suspicious_request_counts` and runs the same threshold logic, `threat_ban_config["rate_limit"]` first if present, otherwise the flat `auto_ban_threshold` / `auto_ban_duration` policy, banning with `reason="rate_limit_exceeded"` (distinct from the `"penetration_attempt"` reason the detection path uses). See [Rate-limit auto-ban](../api/ban-config.md#rate-limit-auto-ban) for the full behavior. Like the rest of the auto-ban state, `suspicious_request_counts` is in-memory and per-process, so multi-replica deployments do not share rate-limit auto-ban counts across replicas.

___

Cloud Provider Blocking
-----------------------

| Field                      | Type             | Default | Description                              |
|----------------------------|------------------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| `block_cloud_providers`    | `frozenset[str] \| None` | `None`  | Providers to block: `"AWS"`, `"GCP"`, `"Azure"`, `"DigitalOcean"`, `"Linode"`, `"Vultr"`. A bare name blocks the whole provider; a region carve-out (`"GCP:!us-central1"`) blocks the provider except that region. Region metadata exists for AWS and GCP only, so a carve-out on the other four exempts nothing and the whole provider stays blocked. An unrecognized provider name raises `ValueError`. |
| `cloud_ip_refresh_interval`| `int`            | `3600`  | Seconds between IP range refreshes (60-86400). |

**Validator**: each entry is valid when the part before an optional `:!region` suffix is one of the six provider names; any invalid entry raises `ValueError` naming it (nothing is silently dropped).

___

Security Headers
----------------

| Field              | Type                   | Default      | Description                          |
|--------------------|------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| `security_headers` | `dict[str, Any] \| None` | See below  | Security headers configuration dict. |

**Default structure**:

```python
{
    "enabled": True,
    "hsts": {"max_age": 31536000, "include_subdomains": True, "preload": False},
    "csp": None,
    "frame_options": "SAMEORIGIN",
    "content_type_options": "nosniff",
    "xss_protection": "1; mode=block",
    "referrer_policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin",
    "permissions_policy": "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()",
    "custom": None,
}
```

___

CORS

**Validator**: `agent_api_key` is required when `enable_agent` is `True`. `agent_buffer_overflow_policy` rejects any value other than `"drop"`, `"block"`, or `"raise"` at construction time.

`SecurityConfig.on_error` (documented under [Core Settings](#core-settings) hooks) is also forwarded to `AgentConfig.on_error` when the agent is enabled, so the same callback receives agent-side `transport_send` and `encryption` failures in addition to guard-core's own `agent_init` and `geoip` failures.

All eleven fields above with a `None` default follow the same rule: `to_agent_config()` omits a field from the `AgentConfig` call entirely when it is `None`, so an unset field is controlled by `AgentConfig`'s own default rather than by a value duplicated into guard-core.

Dynamic Rules
-------------

| Field                   | Type   | Default | Description                                     |
|-------------------------|--------|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `enable_dynamic_rules`  | `bool` | `False` | Enable dynamic rule updates from SaaS platform. |
| `dynamic_rule_interval` | `int`  | `300`   | Seconds between rule update checks.             |
| `emergency_mode`        | `bool` | `False` | Emergency lockdown mode (set by dynamic rules). |
| `emergency_whitelist`   | `list[str]` | `[]`| Emergency whitelist IPs (set by dynamic rules). |

**Validator**: `enable_agent` must be `True` when `enable_dynamic_rules` is `True`.

Validators
----------

`SecurityConfig` includes Pydantic validators that run on instantiation:

| Validator | Fields | Behavior |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `validate_ip_lists` | `whitelist`, `blacklist` | Validates IP addresses and CIDR ranges. Raises `ValueError` on invalid entries. |
| `validate_trusted_proxies` | `trusted_proxies` | Validates proxy IPs and CIDR ranges, plus the literal `"unix"` token. Raises `ValueError` on invalid entries. |
| `warn_trusted_proxies_prefix_zero` | model-level | Logs a `WARNING` when `trusted_proxies` contains a `/0` network. Does not raise; construction still succeeds. |
| `warn_empty_enabled_detection_categories` | model-level | Logs a `WARNING` when `enabled_detection_categories` is empty while `enable_penetration_detection` is `True`. Does not raise; construction still succeeds. |
| `validate_proxy_depth` | `trusted_proxy_depth` | Must be >= 1. Raises `ValueError` otherwise. |
| `validate_cloud_providers` | `block_cloud_providers` | Requires the part before an optional `:!region` suffix to be `"AWS"`, `"GCP"`, or `"Azure"`. Raises `ValueError` naming any entry that fails this check. |
| `validate_geo_ip_handler_exists` | model-level | Requires `geo_ip_handler` when `blocked_countries` or `whitelist_countries` is set. Falls back to `IPInfoManager` if `ipinfo_token` is provided. Also re-run from `__setattr__`/`model_copy` when `blocked_countries`, `whitelist_countries`, `geo_ip_handler`, or `ipinfo_token` is reassigned after construction. |
| `validate_agent_config` | model-level | Requires `agent_api_key` when `enable_agent` is `True`. Requires `enable_agent` when `enable_dynamic_rules` is `True`. |
| `validate_optional_extras_installed` | model-level | Requires the `redis` extra when `enable_redis` is `True`, the `cloud` extra (`aiohttp` or `requests`) when cloud blocking is enabled (`block_cloud_providers` or `enable_dynamic_rules`), and the `geo` extra (`maxminddb`) when country rules are configured with no custom `geo_ip_handler`. Raises `ValueError` naming the missing extra's install command, checked via `importlib.util.find_spec` (never a bare `import`). See [Installation](../installation.md#optional-dependency-extras). |
| `warn_unknown_fields` | model-level, `mode="before"` | Compares the constructor keyword arguments against `model_fields` (and any field's `alias`) and logs a `guard_core.models` warning naming each unknown key, since `SecurityConfig` still allows unknown keys through (`extra="ignore"`) rather than raising. Construction still succeeds and the unknown key is still dropped; only a log line is added, so a typo'd field name is no longer a silent no-op. `extra="forbid"` is the intended behavior at a future major release. |

!!! warning "Unknown provider names raise"
    `validate_cloud_providers` rejects a `block_cloud_providers` entry whose provider name (the part before an optional `:!region` suffix) is not `"AWS"`, `"GCP"`, or `"Azure"`. `{"AWS", "InvalidProvider"}` raises `ValueError` naming `InvalidProvider` instead of silently blocking only `"AWS"`.
