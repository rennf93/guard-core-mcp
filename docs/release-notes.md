Release Notes
=============

___

v0.1.0 (2026-07-25)
-------------------

Config, documentation and detection tools (v0.1.0)
--------------------------------------------------------

- **Added** — `validate_config` — validates a config dict against the real Pydantic `SecurityConfig` / `AgentConfig` model for `fastapi-guard`, `guard-core`, or `guard-agent`, reporting unknown keys (with typo suggestions), validation errors, and deprecation warnings.
- **Added** — `config_fields` — looks up a config field by exact name or fuzzy query, returning its type, default, required-ness, and description straight from the installed Pydantic model.
- **Added** — Bundled documentation for `fastapi-guard`, `guard-core`, and `guard-agent` (95 vendored pages, kept in sync via `scripts/sync_docs.py`), plus `search_docs` and `get_doc` to query it.
- **Added** — `check_payload` — runs a request through guard-core's real detection engine in a Redis-disabled sandbox, reporting whether it would be blocked and by which pattern.
- **Added** — Repo scaffolding matching the rest of the Guard ecosystem: community files, pre-commit and CI tooling configuration, and packaging metadata.

___

v0.0.1 (2026-07-25)
-------------------

Name reservation (v0.0.1)
--------------------------

- **Added** — Initial scaffold published to PyPI to reserve the `guard-core-mcp` name. Only the `versions` tool — reporting which Guard libraries are installed and at what version — is implemented.
